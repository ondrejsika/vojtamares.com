I am studying computer science at [Czech Technical University](https://cvut.cz) at [Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering](https://fjfi.cvut.cz). So I'm in my twenties. I've changed universities, because of that I had to start again.

## Professional career

My first experience with computers was in 2011 when I was hosting a game server for friends. Since then I was interested in linux and after a while I was helpdesk at Czech gamehosting. 

Shortly after my first server went live I got interested in having a website, so I started to learning programming in PHP.

Since 2018 I am a freelancer and while I'm studying, I am trying to find time to work on some projects and make some money.

### Some dates

### Technical interests
There is a list of technologies I am interested in, I'm sure I've missed some so do no take it for granted that what is not here I do not care about.

_git, PHP, Golang, Rust, NodeJS, async programming, distributed systems, cloud, serverless, devops, security, linux (servers), SQL databases (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL), Redis, queues (RabbitMQ, AWS SQS), multiplayer games, realtime apps (chat, data processing), APIs & gRPC, scalable infrastructure, Kotlin, Docker, Kubernetes, nginx_

### Experiences
At some point I have been working (professionally or in personal manner) with these technologies:

_git, PHP, nginx, SQL databses (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL), Sentry, Redis, RabbitMQ, NodeJS (Yarn, Babel, Webpack, Vue.js and some of server-side JS), Python, Java, Golang, Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Alpine), Docker, GitHub & GitLab & BitBucket, Kubernetes, Digital Ocean's cloud (Managed Kubernes), Apache, HTTP API(s)_

## Personal interests

Among computers and other IT things, I have other interests (Hard to believe, right?).

I love hanging out with friends, watching movies, series or going to theater. I love music, live concerts are awesome! And my Spotify subscription is best spent 6 EUR / month.

Sports, I think you need to have healthy relationship with your body. You need to keep your mind satisfied and your body, sports are good way of doing it. My favorite sports are motion based such as parkour and slackline and my latest discovery - paragliding. I guess you can say I like adrenalin (a lot). And also seasonal-based sports such as cycling, skying, paddling (on rivers) and more. And I never got into running.

I like beer, but I'm trying to avoid drinking whenever possible.

One of the things I love to do is traveling, which today is really cheap, but you need to have time and money (at the same time) which for student is quite hard combination to achieve.

Also, I'm a Scout.

In 2019 I joined a non-profit organization [IAESTE](https://www.iaeste.cz) where I'm managing our IT infrastructure at the moment. PS: We have Kubernetes! PSS: I'm volunteering in there!
