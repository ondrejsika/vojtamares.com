**First DevOpsLive livestream by Ondrej Sika, 2nd September 2020**

The topic was how to use Terraform to configure and managed your GitLab (including self-hosted instance) and GitHub.

Ondra began with simple question if everyone is familiar with Terraform and did actually quite big introduction to Terraform for people who never used it before. From there we continued to showing HCL how the declarative file looks and how Terraform works - providers! Providers for all! Also a showcase of Ondra's provider for Linde (with some extra features, built on top of Linode's official provider since it is missing some features).
