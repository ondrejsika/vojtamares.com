Hello, my name is Vojtěch Mareš.

I'm from Czech Republic and I am software engineer, freelancer and for the most university student of computer science.
I have a CAE (C1) in English so we can have a chat :)
Btw. since fall 2019 I'm managing IT infrastructure for a non-profit [IAESTE](https://www.iaeste.cz).

I have about two years of professional experience of writing web applications in PHP. I love backend. Frontend is not a swearing word for me and I like designing UIs, but I am really minimalistic in terms of design and I do not enjoy it as much as backend.

I would love to give a try to Go, Rust programming languages and I really like cloud and serverless approach to building applications. 

In spare time I write open source under [Contributte](https://contributte.org) organization.
