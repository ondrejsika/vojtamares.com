Hello, my name is Vojtěch Mareš.

I'm from Czech Republic and I am software engineer, freelancer and for the most university student of computer science.
I have a CAE (C1) in English so we can have a chat :)
Btw. since fall 2019 I'm managing IT infrastructure for a non-profit [IAESTE](https://www.iaeste.cz).


I have about two years of professional experience of writing web applications in PHP. I love backend, but I work on frontend too.
So I got my hands on JavaScript, (S)CSS, HTML, SQL databases, in-memory databases and message brokers.
I would love to give a try to Go, Rust, async programming (and apps), NoSQL databases and real-time apps in cloud.


In spare time I write open source under [Contributte](https://contributte.org) organization.
