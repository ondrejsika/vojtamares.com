## println("Hello world");

## // My name is Vojtěch Mareš

I'm from Czech Republic and I am software engineer, freelancer and for the most university student of computer science. I am fluent in English (I have [CAE](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/advanced/) to prove it). I have been programming professionaly for about two years. Mostly I work on backend, but I can do some frontend magic too. Personaly I am a fan of Vue.js. I develop web apps in PHP, also I like other programming languages such as Go and Java. And I would love to get into cloud computing. Among programming I am interested in automation and DevOps.

In spare time I'm outside, usualy on slackline or learning paragliding.
