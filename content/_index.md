## Hello, my name is Vojtěch Mareš.

I'm from Czech Republic and I am software engineer, freelancer and for the most university student of computer science. I am fluent in English. I've been programming professionaly for about two years. Mostly I work on backend, but I can do some frontend magic too. I am developing web apps in PHP, also I like other programming languages such as Go, Rust and Java. And I would love to get into cloud computing.

In spare time I write open source under [Contributte](https://contributte.org) organization or I'm outside on slackline.
